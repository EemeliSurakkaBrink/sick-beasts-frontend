# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

Our project is an e-commerce store built for a skate clothing brand that focuses on sustainable, print-on-demand t-shirts. The store has been designed to appeal to young adults, environmentally conscious people, and skaters who appreciate dark humour and a tongue-in-cheek attitude. The core idea is to offer a visually engaging shopping experience that combines an edgy, high-contrast design with smooth, modern functionalities such as an interactive carousel, easy shopping basket management, secure checkout, and integrated customer reviews.

This project is being built to meet the demand for sustainable fashion while showcasing a unique brand personality. The key objectives include delivering a seamless and intuitive user experience, enabling efficient backend management through Laravel and filament, and integrating essential e-commerce functionalities such as guest and registered user checkouts, secure payments (credit cards and PayPal), marketing via email, and social media integration (including Instagram). Success will be measured by a site that is both robust and flexible enough to scale with additional product categories in the future.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   A fully functional e-commerce store that sells sustainable print-on-demand t-shirts.
*   An engaging homepage featuring a cool carousel (built with Swiper.js) showcasing the latest t-shirt designs and customer reviews.
*   A shopping basket and checkout flow that support both guest orders and registered account checkouts.
*   Integration of secure payment methods (credit cards and PayPal) and clear display of shipping/return policies (14 calendar day cooling-off period).
*   An admin interface developed using Laravel and filament for managing products, orders, and customer data.
*   Integration with the Gelato print-on-demand service for t-shirt production and fulfillment.
*   A marketing system for sending emails to registered users and newsletter subscribers, and Instagram feed integration.
*   A user-friendly design using Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn UI elements, maintaining a visually striking, dark, and high-contrast aesthetic with strong accent colours.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Expansion beyond the t-shirt product category at the initial launch (though the architecture will be scalable for future products).
*   Advanced features like detailed analytics or extensive third-party integrations beyond those specified (e.g., additional social media platforms beyond Instagram).
*   Extensive customization of shipping solutions other than the outlined cooling-off period policy.
*   Any offline or in-store integration features.
*   Complex customer loyalty programs or reward systems beyond basic account order tracking.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey begins when a user lands on the homepage of the eco-friendly, skate fashion store. The homepage immediately captures attention with a bold, dark-themed design and an interactive carousel showcasing the latest t-shirt designs and real customer reviews. From there, a visitor can click on a particular design to view detailed information including high-quality images, product descriptions, sustainability production details, and pricing. The site’s navigation, built with Next.js and styled with Tailwind and shadcn, makes it easy for users to explore various product details and additional categories planned for future expansion.

Once a user decides to make a purchase, they add their chosen t-shirt(s) to a shopping basket. The checkout process supports both quick guest orders and a more detailed account-based order tracking system for regular customers. During checkout, users are presented with clear shipping and return policies while selecting their preferred secure payment method (credit card or PayPal). After completing the transaction, the user sees a confirmation page summarizing their order and receives follow-up communication through integrated marketing emails, reinforcing post-purchase engagement and encouraging future visits.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The project relies on the availability and stability of the Gelato print-on-demand service.
*   It is assumed that the necessary APIs (for payment gateways and Instagram) are accessible and can handle the expected load.
*   The site will initially launch with only t-shirts, though it should be architected to allow easy addition of new product categories.
*   The CMS and admin interface will be strictly managed through Laravel and filament; custom feature requests outside those frameworks are out-of-scope for this version.
*   It is assumed that the target hosting environment can support Next.js 15 and Laravel simultaneously with reasonable performance.
*   Developers will primarily use provided tools (Cursor and Claude 3.7 Sonnet) for rapid and effective iterating on the project requirements.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   Integrating multiple technologies (Laravel, Next.js, Tailwind, Swiper.js) requires careful coordination. Ensure that components communicate effectively across the backend and frontend.
*   The Swiper.js carousel, while engaging, may present challenges with responsiveness and performance on older devices; thorough testing across devices is essential.
*   API rate limits and potential reliability issues with external services (Gelato, Instagram, Payment gateways) could affect the user experience. Incorporate error handling and fallback mechanisms.
*   Security around payment processing must be stringent; consider regular security audits and compliance checks.
*   Scalability of the backend to support future product categories might require periodic review of database structure and server performance as traffic grows.
*   The admin interface must be both intuitive and powerful; usability testing with actual store managers is advised to streamline workflow.
