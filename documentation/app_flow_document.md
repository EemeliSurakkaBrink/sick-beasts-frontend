# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand new user lands on the skate clothing brand store, they first encounter a visually striking landing page that reflects a dark and tongue-in-cheek aesthetic. The landing page is designed to immediately catch the attention of environmentally conscious young adults and skaters with bold typography and a cool carousel showcasing the latest sustainable t-shirt designs. From this page, the user is presented with clear options to sign in or sign up. New users can choose to create an account by entering their email address and setting a password, or they can use available social login methods if implemented. The sign-up process is straightforward with prompts for personal details and an optional opt-in for the newsletter so that users can receive marketing emails and updates. For returning users, the sign-in page requires their credentials, and if a user forgets their password, there is an immediate option available to recover it by entering their registered email, after which they receive a recovery link. Once authenticated, users have the option to sign out easily from any page within the app by clicking a clearly labeled sign out link in the navigation menu.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful sign in, the user is brought to a central home page that acts as the main dashboard. This page is designed with a clean and organized layout, where a prominent dark-themed header and navigation bar leads to key sections of the site. The main section includes a highly engaging carousel powered by the swiper.js library that rotates through the latest t-shirt designs, complete with integrated customer reviews and direct links to product pages. In addition to the carousel, the dashboard features quick access to product categories and a dedicated shopping basket icon, where users can review their selected items. The navigation bar also provides access to the account management section, checkout process, and marketing newsletter sign-up, ensuring that users can easily move between the store’s different features.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user interacts with the carousel on the home page, clicking on a t-shirt design transitions the display to a detailed product page. On this page, they can view high-quality images, read detailed descriptions, and learn about the sustainability of the print-on-demand process via Gelato. The product pages incorporate the brand’s irreverent tone, with visual elements that reflect the dark humour and tongue-in-cheek style. Users can add the selected t-shirt to their shopping basket with a clear call-to-action button. After adding products to their basket, the user is routed to the shopping cart page, where their selected items are listed alongside price details and the opportunity to adjust quantities or remove items. From the shopping cart, proceeding to checkout provides a seamless transition to the checkout form, where users can choose between a guest checkout or creating an account to enable order tracking and history. During the checkout flow, shipping policies, especially the 14-day cooling-off period details, are clearly displayed alongside available payment options, which include credit cards and PayPal. Additionally, post-purchase, users are directed to an order confirmation page that summarizes their purchase and ensures that shipping and billing details are accurate. For advanced users or administrators, there exists a separate admin panel accessed through a secure login that allows for management of products, orders, and customer data through a Laravel and filament.php based interface. The admin interface includes its own navigation and functionality, including marketing email configuration and Instagram feed management, ensuring a full integration with front-end user interactions.

## Settings and Account Management

Within their account area, users have the ability to review and manage their personal information, view order history, and update their preferences, such as opting in or out of marketing emails. The settings section is accessible from the main navigation, and upon entering, users see a layout where personal details can be edited, notification preferences adjusted, and password changes initiated if needed. Additionally, if the user has registered for an account, they can see their past orders along with tracking information. The integrated system also provides access to billing information and subscription settings for newsletters or special offers. Once changes are saved, users are smoothly routed back to the main dashboard, ensuring it is easy to resume shopping or further explore the site.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the application, various error states are carefully handled in a user-friendly manner. Should a user enter invalid data during sign up or checkout, clear error messages appear on the same page detailing the necessary corrections without abruptly ending the user journey. In cases where connectivity issues occur, the system provides a fallback message that explains the temporary loss of service and offers an option to retry the action later. Additionally, when a user attempts to access a restricted section without proper permissions, such as the admin panel, they are redirected to an error page that explains the access limitation and provides options to navigate back to the previous or main page. The error interactions are designed to maintain the site’s overall aesthetic and tone, making even error messages feel integrated with the overall brand style.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey of using the skate clothing brand’s e-commerce platform is designed to be intuitive, engaging, and reflective of its unique brand personality. From the first moment a new user lands on the homepage, they are drawn into an experience that features cutting-edge design with a cool carousel of t-shirt designs and a clear layout that makes navigation effortless. Whether shopping as a guest or registering for enhanced features like order tracking, the checkout process is smooth and transparent, clearly displaying policies and available payment methods. The backend administrative system ensures that store managers can efficiently update products and manage orders. All error states and alternate paths are addressed to guide users back to their intended actions seamlessly. By connecting every page and flow—from onboarding to post-purchase engagement—the app provides a complete and user-friendly journey that mirrors the adventurous and bold spirit of its environmentally conscious and humor-loving audience.
