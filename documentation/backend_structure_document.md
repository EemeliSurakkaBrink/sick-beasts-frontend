# Backend Structure Document

This document explains in everyday language how our backend is built, hosted, and maintained. It covers all aspects from the overall system design to the details of each component, which includes order processing, customer management, and critical integrations for an e-commerce store that sells sustainable print-on-demand t-shirts.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend runs on a robust and scalable architecture built on Sanity CMS, a modern headless content management system. Key points include:

*   **CMS and Design Patterns:**

    *   Sanity CMS provides a flexible and real-time collaborative editing experience that allows us to manage content with efficiency.
    *   Sanity's structured content approach ensures dynamic data manipulation and multi-channel delivery.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   The architecture is designed to easily add more product categories and new features like additional marketing integrations as the business grows.

*   **Maintainability & Performance:**

    *   Clear data structures and Sanity's GROQ query language contribute to straightforward improvements and troubleshooting.

## 2. Database Management

Our system integrates with Sanity's back-end capabilities to securely store and manage the data needed for orders, customers, products, and beyond. We utilize a structured content approach to ensure data integrity and easy retrieval:

*   **Database Technology:**

    *   **Sanity Datastore:** Sanity manages content in a schema-driven manner that fits well with our scalability and data consistency requirements.

*   **Data Structure and Access:**

    *   Content is organized in documents representing key entities like users, orders, products, and newsletters.
    *   Relationships between these documents (for instance, a customer placing multiple orders) are clearly handled using relational links in Sanity.

*   **Best Practices:**

    *   Secure API queries, regular content backups, and optimized indexing for performance at scale.

## 3. Database Schema

Below is a human-readable description of the main content schema within Sanity along with structured examples for clarity.

### Human Readable Schema Layout:

*   **Users Document:**

    *   Stores customer information such as name, email, address, and login identifiers.

*   **Orders Document:**

    *   Records information about each order placed, linking it to a user, and contains details like order status, totals, and timestamps.

*   **Products Document:**

    *   Contains details about the t-shirts, including design, pricing, and sustainability attributes.

*   **Inventory Document:**

    *   Synced with the print-on-demand service (Gelato) to manage product stock.

*   **Newsletters Document:**

    *   Manages email subscribers and campaign details for our marketing emails.

*   **Transactions Document:**

    *   Holds payment information related to credit card and PayPal transactions, ensuring financial data is recorded securely.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our backend uses RESTful APIs available through Sanity to allow seamless communication between the frontend and the backend services. Here’s an overview of the API design:

*   **Design Approach:**

    *   Utilizing REST principles for clarity and simplicity, with endpoints that possess clear purposes and predictable responses.
    *   Endpoints support CRUD operations for handling orders, user profiles, newsletter subscriptions, and more.

*   **Key Endpoints Include:**

    *   **Order Management:**

        *   POST /orders: Create new orders
        *   GET /orders: Retrieve a list of orders
        *   PUT /orders/{id}: Update order details
        *   DELETE /orders/{id}: Cancel an order

    *   **Customer Management:**

        *   POST /users: Create a new user account
        *   GET /users/{id}: Get detailed user information

    *   **Product & Inventory:**

        *   GET /products: List all products
        *   PUT /inventory/{id}: Update inventory levels by syncing with Gelato

    *   **Transaction Processing:**

        *   POST /transactions: Record payment details and process payment information through credit cards and PayPal.

    *   **Newsletter & Email Marketing:**

        *   POST /newsletters: Subscribe an email for marketing
        *   GET /newsletters: Retrieve subscribers for analytics

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on a reliable cloud platform that ensures high uptime and easy scaling. Key highlights:

*   **Cloud Provider:**

    *   We use a cloud service (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, or similar) that supports deployments with Sanity and offers managed databases, load balancers, and more.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** High uptime and resilience, ensuring our store is available when customers need it.
    *   **Scalability:** Resources can be scaled up automatically based on demand.
    *   **Cost-effectiveness:** Pay for what you use while still having access to enterprise-grade features and security.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

To ensure fast and smooth operation, our backend infrastructure includes various components that work together:

*   **Load Balancers:**

    *   Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, so no single server is overwhelmed.

*   **Caching Mechanisms:**

    *   Frequently accessed data is cached to speed up response times, making the user experience smoother.

*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**

    *   Static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files are served quickly via CDNs globally.

*   **Other Key Components:**

    *   **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adds or removes servers based on traffic needs.
    *   **Backup Services:** Regular backups ensure data is safe.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is paramount in our backend infrastructure. Here’s how we protect our system and its data:

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**

    *   Secure login systems utilizing Sanity's security protocols.
    *   User roles and permissions ensure that admins and regular users have appropriate access.

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, securing sensitive information like payment details and passwords.

*   **Additional Security Practices:**

    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for content management and endpoints.
    *   Regular security audits and updates to dependencies to keep vulnerabilities at bay.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping our backend running smoothly requires constant monitoring and regular maintenance:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Tools such as New Relic, Sentry, or similar services help track performance, error rates, and overall server health.
    *   Logging systems record all API requests and server activities for easier troubleshooting.

*   **Maintenance Strategies:**

    *   Scheduled maintenance windows for updates and patches to reduce downtime.
    *   Automated alerting systems notify the team when unusual activity or errors occur.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

Our backend structure is carefully designed to meet the needs of a modern, scalable e-commerce store. Key takeaways include:

*   **Scalable & Secure Architecture:** Using Sanity CMS to ensure efficient content management and ease of scaling.
