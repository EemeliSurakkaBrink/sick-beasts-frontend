# Backend Structure Document

This document explains in everyday language how our backend is built, hosted, and maintained. It covers all aspects from the overall system design to the details of each component, which includes order processing, customer management, and critical integrations for an e-commerce store that sells sustainable print-on-demand t-shirts.

## 1. Backend Architecture

Our backend runs on a robust and scalable architecture built primarily on Laravel, a PHP framework known for its elegant syntax and powerful features. Key points include:

*   **Framework & Design Patterns:**

    *   Laravel’s MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture keeps business logic, user interface, and data handling separate for clarity and maintenance.
    *   We use filament.php as an admin interface for easy and secure management of products, orders, and customer data.

*   **Scalability:**

    *   The architecture is designed to easily add more product categories and new features like additional marketing integrations as the business grows.

*   **Maintainability & Performance:**

    *   Clean, well-organized code, adherence to coding standards, and built-in tools from Laravel ensure that improvements and troubleshooting are straightforward.

## 2. Database Management

Our system uses modern database solutions to securely store and manage the data needed for orders, customers, products, and beyond. We rely on a relational database approach to ensure data integrity and easy retrieval:

*   **Database Technology:**

    *   **SQL Database:** We use a SQL-based system, which complements Laravel’s Eloquent ORM, making database interactions both intuitive and efficient.

*   **Data Structure and Access:**

    *   Data is organized in tables representing key entities like users, orders, products, and newsletters.
    *   Relationships between these tables (for instance, a customer placing multiple orders) are clearly defined.

*   **Best Practices:**

    *   Secure queries, regular backups, and well-indexed tables to ensure the system performs quickly even when scaled up.

## 3. Database Schema

Below is a human-readable description of the main database schema along with SQL examples for clarity.

### Human Readable Schema Layout:

*   **Users Table:**

    *   Stores customer information such as name, email, address, and login credentials.

*   **Orders Table:**

    *   Records information about each order placed, linking it to a user, and contains details like order status, totals, and timestamps.

*   **Products Table:**

    *   Contains details about the t-shirts, including design, pricing, and sustainability attributes.

*   **Inventory Table:**

    *   Keeps track of product stock and syncs with the print-on-demand service (Gelato).

*   **Newsletters Table:**

    *   Manages email subscribers and campaign details for our marketing emails.

*   **Transactions Table:**

    *   Holds payment information related to credit card and Paypal transactions, ensuring financial data is recorded securely.

### SQL Schema Example (PostgreSQL):

-- Users Table

CREATE TABLE users ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, address TEXT, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Orders Table

CREATE TABLE orders ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id), status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Products Table

CREATE TABLE products ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, description TEXT, price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, stock INTEGER DEFAULT 0, created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Inventory Table

CREATE TABLE inventory ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id), quantity INTEGER NOT NULL, last_synced TIMESTAMP );

-- Newsletters Table

CREATE TABLE newsletters ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, subscribed BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE, subscribe_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Transactions Table

CREATE TABLE transactions ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders(id), payment_method VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- E.g., 'Credit Card', 'PayPal' transaction_status VARCHAR(50), amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL, processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Our backend uses RESTful APIs to allow seamless communication between the frontend and the backend services. Here’s an overview of the API design:

*   **Design Approach:**

    *   Using REST principles for clarity and simplicity. Each endpoint has a clear purpose and predictable responses.
    *   The endpoints support CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for handling orders, user profiles, newsletter subscriptions, and more.

*   **Key Endpoints Include:**

    *   **Order Management:**

        *   POST /orders: Create new orders
        *   GET /orders: Retrieve a list of orders
        *   PUT /orders/{id}: Update order details
        *   DELETE /orders/{id}: Cancel an order

    *   **Customer Management:**

        *   POST /users: Create a new user account
        *   GET /users/{id}: Get detailed user information

    *   **Product & Inventory:**

        *   GET /products: List all products
        *   PUT /inventory/{id}: Update inventory levels by syncing with Gelato

    *   **Transaction Processing:**

        *   POST /transactions: Record payment details and process payment information through credit cards and PayPal.

    *   **Newsletter & Email Marketing:**

        *   POST /newsletters: Subscribe an email for marketing
        *   GET /newsletters: Retrieve subscribers for analytics

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted on a reliable cloud platform that ensures high uptime and easy scaling. Key highlights:

*   **Cloud Provider:**

    *   We use a cloud service (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean, or similar) that supports PHP applications and offers managed databases, load balancers, and more.

*   **Benefits:**

    *   **Reliability:** High uptime and resilience, meaning our store is available when customers need it.
    *   **Scalability:** Resources can be scaled up automatically based on demand.
    *   **Cost-effectiveness:** Pay for what you use while still having access to enterprise-grade features and security.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

To ensure fast and smooth operation, our backend infrastructure includes various components that work together:

*   **Load Balancers:**

    *   Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, so no single server is overwhelmed.

*   **Caching Mechanisms:**

    *   Frequently accessed data is cached to speed up response times, making the user experience smoother.

*   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**

    *   Static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files are served quickly via CDNs globally.

*   **Other Key Components:**

    *   **Auto Scaling:** Automatically adds or removes servers based on traffic needs.
    *   **Backup Services:** Regular backups ensure data is safe.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is paramount in our backend infrastructure. Here’s how we protect our system and its data:

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**

    *   Secure login systems using Laravel’s built-in authentication mechanisms.
    *   User roles and permissions ensure that admins and regular users have appropriate access.

*   **Data Encryption:**

    *   Data is encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest, securing sensitive information like payment details and passwords.

*   **Additional Security Practices:**

    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection for forms and endpoints.
    *   Regular security audits and updates to dependencies to keep vulnerabilities at bay.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Keeping our backend running smoothly requires constant monitoring and regular maintenance:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**

    *   Tools such as New Relic, Sentry, or similar services help track performance, error rates, and overall server health.
    *   Logging systems record all API requests and server activities for easier troubleshooting.

*   **Maintenance Strategies:**

    *   Scheduled maintenance windows for updates and patches to reduce downtime.
    *   Automated alerting systems notify the team when unusual activity or errors occur.
