# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Initialize a new Git repository named `e-commerce-skate-store` in your working directory. *(Source: Project Overview)*
2.  Create two main directories: one for the frontend (`/frontend`) and one for the backend (`/backend`). *(Source: Project Overview)*
3.  Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine; if not, install an LTS version (e.g., Node.js v20.2.1). *(Source: Tech Stack: Core Tools)*
4.  Install Composer if not already installed to manage the Laravel project in the backend. *(Source: Tech Stack: Laravel)*
5.  **Validation**: Run `git status`, `node -v`, and `composer --version` to confirm the installations and repository setup.

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Create a new Next.js project in the `/frontend` folder using Next.js 14 (note: although the requirements mention Next.js 15, install Next.js 14 as it is better suited with current AI coding tools). *(Source: Tech Stack: Frontend)

    *   Command: `npx create-next-app@14 .`

2.  Set up Tailwind CSS for styling by installing it and creating a `tailwind.config.js` file in `/frontend`. *(Source: Tech Stack: Tailwind CSS)*

3.  Configure the global CSS file (`/frontend/styles/globals.css`) to include Tailwind directives. *(Source: Tech Stack: Tailwind CSS)*

4.  Install and configure shadcn for UI elements by adding its package to the project. *(Source: Tech Stack: shadcn)*

5.  Create a carousel component at `/frontend/src/components/Carousel.js` that utilizes Swiper.js to showcase the latest t-shirt designs and customer reviews. *(Source: Key Features: Cool Carousel UI)

6.  Install Swiper.js package in the frontend using npm. *(Source: Key Features: Cool Carousel UI)*

7.  Create the shopping basket UI component at `/frontend/src/components/ShoppingBasket.js` with functionality to add t-shirts and view basket contents. *(Source: Key Features: Shopping Basket & Checkout)*

8.  Develop a checkout page at `/frontend/src/pages/checkout.js` that supports both guest checkouts and logged-in user orders. *(Source: Key Features: Shopping Basket & Checkout)

9.  Apply design preferences: use a dark color scheme (primarily black with strong accents) and incorporate punk-inspired fonts (e.g., Punk Kid font from 1001fonts.com) within your CSS and component styles. *(Source: Design Preferences)

10. **Validation**: Run `npm run dev` from the `/frontend` directory and visually verify that the homepage displays the carousel and shopping basket correctly.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize a new Laravel project in the `/backend` directory using Composer. *(Source: Tech Stack: Laravel)
2.  Install filament.php in the Laravel project to set up the admin interface. *(Source: Key Features: Admin Interface)
3.  Create an Admin Controller at `/backend/app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php` to manage products, orders, and customer data. *(Source: Key Features: Admin Interface)
4.  Set up API routes in `/backend/routes/api.php` for user authentication, order management, and checkout operations. *(Source: Key Features: Shopping Basket & Checkout)
5.  Develop a service class at `/backend/app/Services/GelatoService.php` to integrate with the Gelato print-on-demand API for t-shirt printing and fulfillment. *(Source: Integrations: Gelato)
6.  Create a Payment Controller at `/backend/app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php` that handles payment processing for both credit cards and PayPal. *(Source: Key Features: Payment Methods)
7.  Configure shipping and return policies by adding business logic (14-calendar day cooling-off period) in the order processing module within `/backend/app/Models/Order.php` or a dedicated service file. *(Source: E-commerce Functionality & Policies)
8.  **Validation**: Use Postman to test the API endpoints (authentication, order creation, payment processing) ensuring they return expected responses.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  Connect the frontend shopping basket and checkout pages to the backend API endpoints by creating a service file at `/frontend/src/services/api.js` that uses axios to send requests. *(Source: App Flow: E-commerce Functionality)
2.  Configure Laravel’s authentication (for both guest and registered users) by implementing Sanctum middleware in `/backend/app/Http/Middleware/Authenticate.php`. *(Source: Key Features: Shopping Basket & Checkout)
3.  Integrate the marketing email system on the backend using Laravel’s mailing features by updating `/backend/.env` with SMTP settings and adding email-sending logic in a dedicated mail controller. *(Source: Key Features: Marketing System)
4.  Add an Instagram integration by embedding Instagram’s widget script in a new component at `/frontend/src/components/InstagramWidget.js`. *(Source: Integrations: Instagram)
5.  **Validation**: Simulate a complete user flow by adding an item to the basket, proceeding through checkout, and processing a payment using dummy data to verify proper communication between frontend and backend.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Set up environment configuration files for production in `/frontend/.env.production` and `/backend/.env.production` with secure API keys and database credentials. *(Source: Project Overview)
2.  Configure a CI/CD pipeline within the Cursor IDE to automate builds and deployments. *(Source: Tools: Cursor)
3.  Deploy the Laravel backend to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using a configuration file located at `/infra/aws/beanstalk.yaml` (specify region and account details if available, e.g., AWS region `us-east-1`). *(Source: Tech Stack: Deployment)
4.  Deploy the Next.js frontend to Vercel ensuring build settings respect the Next.js 14 setup. *(Source: Tech Stack: Deployment)
5.  Securely integrate the payment gateway credentials and ensure proper SSL configuration on both platforms. *(Source: E-commerce Functionality & Policies)
6.  **Validation**: Run end-to-end tests using an automated testing tool (e.g., Cypress) against the production URL to verify that both the storefront and admin interface work as intended.
